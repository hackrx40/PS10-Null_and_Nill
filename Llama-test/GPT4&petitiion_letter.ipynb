That on the fateful day of 27-05-2019, the deGeased was going to his house from Nangal on his motorcycle bearing No. PB-12-U-8980 which was driven by the deceased in proper care and by observing all the traffic rules and when at about 8:00PM the deceased feached near the Kamla Tile Industry village Talwara then he collided with the tanker/tipper bearing No. PB-12-M-9609 which was parked on the road without any parking lights or indicators. Due to said collusion the deceased fell down on the road and received grievous injuries on his head and died at the spoi. The ys deceased was immediately taken to BBMB Hospital Nangal by his brother who was also coming behind the deceased on his separate, motorcycle bearing No. PB-12-R-5602, but the doctors of BBMB Hospital Nangal has declared Gurmail Singh brought dead. The postmortem of the deceased was conducted by the docots of BBMB Hospital on 28-05-2019. . That the said accident entirely took place due to the wrong parking of the tipper bearing No. PB-12-M-9609 by its driver i.e. respondent No.2 which was wrongly parked by the respondent No.2 without any parking . lights or any indicator. That the accident was witnessed by Hajara Singh son of Swarna brother of the deceased and on the statement of Hajara Singh an FIR No. 0037 dated 28-05-2019 under section 283, 304-A, 427 IPC was registered against the respondent No. 1 in PS Nangal. Therefore the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. It is pertinent to mention here that earlier the number of the offending vehicle was wrongly mentioned in the FIR as PB-12-M-9605 as the complainant was the brother of the deceased and due to death of his brother, he was under extreme shock. Due to said fact, he has wrongly mentioned the number asPBY 12-1 M-9605 in place of PB-12-M-9609, which was later on corrected by the complainant Hajara Singh by giving the statement to thep olice. It is therefore respectfully prayed that claim petition be accepted and oa _ compensation to the tune of Rs. 1,00,00,000/- (Rs. One Crore) plus Rs. } 50,000/- on last rites and Bhog Ceremony may kindly be awarded to the ae claimants alongwith interest @ 12% P.A. from the date of accident till its realization, in the interest of justice.
